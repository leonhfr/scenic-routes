# Scenic Routes

## What is it?

You are new to a city. You want to go from A to B. However, the route between those two points is always the same: the shortest one. Taking the same route everyday is boring; I wanted new routes that make me see interesting stuff. Scenic Routes is a web application written in JavaScript that provides just that.

## Screenshots and details

In the first view, you start with a heatmap of Barcelona representing the locations of the 10,000 most interesting Flickr pictures taken in that area.

Zoom in, and the photos are clustered into interesting points. The more pictures have been taken at a point, the more interesting it is.

In the second view, you can get routed through those points. The routing algorithm enforces some rules:
- The more interesting a point is, the more likely you will get routed through it.
- The longer the route, the wider the search radius is and the more interesting points you will be routed through.
- Detours are allowed, but the commute is still kept to a reasonable amount of time.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

* You will need to get Flickr and Mapbox API keys.
* You need to have a redis database running.
* You will also need the [Scenic Routes client](https://github.com/leonhfr/scenic-routes-client) if you want any sort of useful interaction with the application.

### Installation

1. First, clone the repository and create a `.env` file as shown in `.env.example`:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/leonhfr/scenic-routes.git
cd scenic-routes
cp .env.example .env
# Atom or your favorite editor:
atom .env
# Adjust variables, add Flickr and Mapbox keys.
# Save the file.
```
2. If you run the app for the first time, you will need to build the database and the static GeoJSON files. Run `npm run first-time`
3. Then, to run the back-end `npm start`
